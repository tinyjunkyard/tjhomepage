'Tiny' refers to the fact that we support a digital junkyard that is in constant state of motion via planning, selling, trading, and maintenance, with recycling or disposal as a last option. Our goal is to divert more and landfill less.</p>

<p class="mt0 mb4 mw6">Tiny Junkyard is a connector that helps us to have virtual space to work from. Alot of the work that needs to be done is basically PLANNING, coming up with a good design...
